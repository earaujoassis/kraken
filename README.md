# Kraken

> Kraken is a custom platform for personal knowledge management

Kraken was conceived as a conjuction between a previous project named `memex`, which is
described as "A personal platform knowledge base system (memex); a personal, multi-device
application to keep track of readings, writings and research projects". We added the
file management into it in order to keep track of not only documents (from a documents-store),
but also files and other documents (like PDF, images etc).

Kraken is a multi-service system; its back-end is written in Python, through Flask and Pymongo,
and its front-end is written in JavaScript, from the original Memex project. The back-end
(`core`) is LICENSED under the "MIT License" and the front-end (`memex`) is LICENSED under the
"GNU AFFERO GPL, Version 3". Please refer to each LICENSE file for more details.
